You know, I was God once. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Bite my shiny metal ass. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. **Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!** _Too much work._ Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

## Yeah, lots of people did.

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Okay, I like a challenge. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

1. Shut up and get to the point!
2. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.
3. You don't know how to do any of those.

### Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

I'm Santa Claus! With gusto. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. You are the last hope of the universe.

* Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
* Take me to your leader!
* Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

Throw her in the brig. Look, last night was a mistake. Soothe us with sweet lies. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. But I've never been to the moon! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? I'm Santa Claus! Bite my shiny metal ass.

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

Soon enough. Shut up and get to the point! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. A true inspiration for the children. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Look, last night was a mistake. Hey, whatcha watching? I'll get my kit!

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! I don't want to be rescued. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
